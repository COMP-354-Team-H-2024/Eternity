FUNCTION log_base_b(x, b, tolerance):
    IF x is less than or equal to 0 OR b is less than or equal to 1:
        SHOW error message: "x must be greater than 0 and base b must be greater than 1"
        STOP the program

    SET the lower bound (low) to 0
    SET the upper bound (high) to x
    SET the guess to the middle point between low and high (guess = (low + high) / 2)

    REPEAT the following steps until the difference between b^guess and x is smaller than tolerance:
        IF b raised to the power of guess is less than x:
            SET the lower bound (low) to guess
        ELSE:
            SET the upper bound (high) to guess
        END IF

        UPDATE the guess to the middle point between low and high

    RETURN the guess as the result

END FUNCTION
